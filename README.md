# IoT Fall Detection System with Edge AI

This project presents an IoT-based fall detection and emergency monitoring system designed for assisted living environments.

## System Overview
The system is composed of:
- Arduino Uno R4 WiFi for sensor acquisition and local control
- Raspberry Pi for edge computing and AI-based analysis
- ThingSpeak for cloud data visualisation

## Features
- Fall detection using accelerometer data
- Panic button with multi-click logic
- Local alerts using LED and buzzer
- Edge AI for intelligent pattern recognition
- Cloud-based monitoring via ThingSpeak

## Repository Structure
- `/arduino`: Arduino firmware
- `/raspberry-pi`: Edge AI and server scripts
